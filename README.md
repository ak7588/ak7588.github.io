CommLab Project 1: Mystery House — Halloween 30MFF Premiere

This repository presents a web page for a short movie “Mystery House” that was filmed and edited in only 30 minutes! The theme of the movie is related to a mystery theft happening in the house of three friends while they were gone for a late night adventure. Hence, the main concept of the web page is to re-create an experience of “mystery”, “adventure”, “puzzle”, and a little “horror” — all of which I decided to relate to the upcoming Halloween, which is also known as the most mysterious night of the year.

The actual implementation of the concept begins with the font, color, and image choices for the web page. The home page has an image of the “Mystery House” — an open source image I took from the Unsplash. After playing around with the CSS, I created a dark blue-to-white gradient that intends to deliver the effect of smoke and thus the “mystery”. I chose the fonts for the header to be Halloween-specific to also translate the theme of the movie. 

In terms of the UI/UX, I chose to include the main information — time, date, and tickets — on the main page for the user to have this right away, i.e. having the “one click away” experience. Other pages, such as “About”, “Cast and Crew”, and “Reviews” are also included in the navigation bar. Clicking on the links leads to the section with the corresponding id address. 

A separate page for the “Already Watched?” navigation tab has also been added to the main page to ensure that users who have already watched the film continued to be engaged with content by being subscribed to the newsletter for latest film updates and leaving reviews for the film.

For me, the main challenges while implementing this project was definitely the technical part. Creating flexbox layouts for the “Cast and Crew” and “Reviews” sections took the most time to figure out. I also tried to include some interactivity by clicking on links, “filling” the forms, and “buying” tickets with Javascript alerts, but the scripted interactivity itself is something I wish to improve upon more in the future.

Overall, I feel like the web page does “communicate” in its own way by inviting the user for a mysterious Halloween adventure and creating a sense of urgency to “be a part” of the story.
